A header builder that works with any theme. Front-end drag&drop interface to create pixel perfect headers with ease.

== Description ==

Stax is a front-end drag & drop visual header builder plugin for WordPress enabling the creation of page headers in a live, visual way. This lets you focus on the look and design of your page headers, instead of tripping over the behind-the-scenes mechanics of building headers.
Check out **[Stax Builder demos](https://staxbuilder.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)**.

= Works with any theme =
Yes that is right, it doesn't matter the theme you are using. Even more cool is that you can change the theme and you can keep your built header.

= Mobile/Tablet/Desktop different content & settings =
You won't see this in any other builder. Just an example is to have your logo in one place on desktop and centered on mobile. You can change the content just on a specific resolution if you like or just the settings of an element. How cool is that?

= Live design - like it should be =
See live how your header looks, right at the moment of edit. Easily switch from desktop, tablet or mobile view

= Unlimited headers =
For real, you can have as many headers on your site. Change background, border, typography, make'em sticky, boxed, full-width, custom height, custom width.

= Deleted items history =
Removed an elements you now want back? Say no more, Deleted Items to the rescue

= STAX Builder Pro. Create a really professional header =
Header resize, Header Slide up, Header transparent. Different logo for resize and transparent states.
Templates.
Import/Export Headers.
Saved Elements.
Page level header.
And many more.
